              The Family Oriented Music Organization is a family owned music store that’s been
              operating in Utah Valley since 1952. They have been profitable but are always looking
              for ways to improve their business. Their in-store point-of-sale system is starting to
              show its age, so the FOMO owners are looking into a web-based system. They are
              seeking proposals from software developers.

              Johan Anderson knows he needs a top-quality information system to run his business,
              and in this document he shares with us his thoughts on the business processes that
              support the company. Johan started by sharing his vision of FOMO:
            </p>
            <p>
              “The Family Oriented Music Organization is a store that aims to satisfy the musical needs of musicians
              and budding musicians in the area. We provide instruments, accessories, repairs, sheet music, and
              training opportunities. Our store has four main revenue streams: sales, rentals, venue
              hosting and services.”
